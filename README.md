# rickrollrc

Bash script which [rickrolls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling) your
terminal by playing Rick Astley‚Äôs ‚ÄúNever Gonna Give You Up‚Äù with ANSI 256-color
coded UTF-8 characters + audio (if available).

## How to Roll
To start rickrollin‚Äô immediately:

    curl -s -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keroserene/rickrollrc/master/roll.sh | bash
Here is the clandestine command you can give to your friends üòà

Since this is a colorful hobby, you need to ensure 256-color mode is enabled or
Astley will look sad.

For example, if you use GNU screen, ensure your ~/.screenrc contains something
like:

    termcapinfo xterm 'Co#256:AB=\E[48;5;%dm:AF=\E[38;5;%dm'
    defbce "on"

Kudos to jart for our lovely hiptext shenanigans.
Please see our sister project: [hiptext](https://github.com/jart/hiptext), which
generates ANSI color codes for any image or video.
